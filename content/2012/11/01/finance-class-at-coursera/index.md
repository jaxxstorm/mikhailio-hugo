I've recently received a statement of accomplishment document for [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/ "Coursera")'s online [Introduction to Finance class](https://www.coursera.org/course/introfinance "Introduction to Finance class") that I took in July-September this year.

The course was lead by prof. Gautam Kaul from University of Michigan. The level of lectures was really introductory, the pace was very slow (too slow for me, even watching x1.5 speed). You could learn about basic finance principles like time value of money, calculating cash flows and discounted values, about stocks and bonds, and risk/return relations.

I liked a lot the assignment tests, which were much stronger and solid then the examples in lectures. They were challenging most of the time, so I'm glad I managed to get 100% score in the end :)

Recommended for anyone who has no idea about what finance is about, but not for experienced students.
