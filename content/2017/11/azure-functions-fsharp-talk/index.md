On November 8th 2017 I gave a talk about developing Azure Functions
in F# at
[FSharping](https://www.meetup.com/FSharping/events/244137693/)
meetup in Prague.

I really enjoyed giving this talk: the audience was
great and asked awesome questions. One more prove that F# community is
so welcoming and energizing!

All the demos of that session can be found in my
[github repository](https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/azure-functions-fsharp-examples).

The slides were only a small portion of my talk, but you can see them
below anyways.
