I.

I think I'm reasonably good at going through interviews.

When I was open for a job change a couple of years ago, I interviewed at eight companies here in the Netherlands where I live. I got job offers from seven of them. Of course, I have plenty of experience and the market was really hot and candidate-friendly, but anyways. The Dutch interviews are not as expensive as a typical process in the US companies. Time-to-offer ranged from 40 minutes to 4 hours of conversations. There would typically be no coding assessment, or a home-completed assessment.

I had two interviews at U.S. companies two. I got offers from both of them.

Amazon flew me to Stockholm for a day. I spent a day or two reading about interview at Amazon and books on algorithms. They hired a hotel room and hosted 4 1-hour sessions with me. (They had multiple interviews going on at the same time, a hiring event). There was a whiteboard, and every new interviewer would give me a coding or design challenge to solve within that hour. I wasn't well-calibrated for such interviews, and couldn't quite tell if I'm performing well or not.

Apparently, I was okay, because I got an offer to relocate to Canada and work on some AWS projects. When, after long considerations, we decided we don't want to go to Vancouver, they switched the offer for Luxembourg. They even paid me and my family to go there for three days, made a tour around the office, and helped with some housing viewings.

I also had an interview with Jet.com - Amazon's competitor in retail - in Dublin. A similar format of 4 1-hour interviews with whiteboards, although it felt much easier. Interestingly, it was two weeks after the interview at Amazon, and the offers came 1 day apart.

I feel like I'm decent with interviews.

II.

There's one big problem with this narrative. I refused all of those offers. I didn't feel like these were enough of a step forward for me.

I my whole 18-years career as a software developer, only once did I take a job offer from an interview, and I left that company in less than a year, despite being already promoted in my role. How did I get other jobs? Mostly, accidentally.

I got my first paid gig when I was a 18-year-old student via my father. We talked about some of my hobby projects and then he showed me some screenshots of the apps he was using at work and asked me if I can create those types of apps. He knew nothing about software development but needed a bunch of utilities to calibrate hardware they were working on. Sure, I know Delphi and C++ Builder, so I can make form-based apps. I prototyped one for him, and got my first salary of $100. I started working for the company and spent the next 2.5 years taking over a bunch of applications and learning the tech on the job. By the end of that engagement, I was writing all software in their stack from C code on microcontrollers with directly addressable memory to 60-screen windows apps.

There wasn't much to learn there anymore, still being a student, I hoped on a three-week free course ogranized by a larger company that focused on software development contracting. They were teaching free classes with a motivation to observe the students and hire the most promising ones. I scored the 2nd place on the overall leaderboard and got hired on a double of my previous salary.

I spent five years there, learning from many amazing people I trying myself in different roles from individual coder to a technology "expert" to a team lead to a project manager. I've been doing contracting projects for European customers, and in the end I quit the company to try doing contracting on my own. A friend of mine connected me to a guy in the Netherlands who needed help with his ongoing projects. The guy just gave me the first task, I completed it, he paid. The second task, the first ongoing project, the second project, and I got rolling.

I spent next years working from my living room. My contact in the Netherlands got hired by Qualcomm, so I mostly worked on a project for them. Eventually, they decided to hire me full time and we moved from Russia to the Netherlands. Qualcomm had a process for hiring, I did fly to an onsite "interview", which was literally saying hi to everyone and then working on the project for the rest of the day.

III.

The other day, I've been interviewing somebody for a dev role at Pulumi, where I currently work. They had a screen interview first, and now going through five rounds of tech interviews, very common for anyone applying for a software engineering job in the U.S. Live-coding, design questions, debugging problems, tell-me-about-the-time-when situations.

Except, I never had a single interview at Pulumi. I jumped on their product as a user as soon as got out in the public. I enjoyed it, wrote a couple of blog posts, used it for my pet projects, gave one of the first talks about Pulumi.

When I was in Seattle for Microsoft MVP summit, I pinged Pulumi slack and I grabbed a beer with Luke, our CTO on Saturday. I started doing some paid contracting for Pulumi, starting with some blogs, docs, examples, then fixing tiny issues here and there, then went to Seattle again for the 1.0 launch and a week onsite. Finally, I got the contract signed for the full-time employment.

I had zero interviews. I had no experience with Go and very limited TypeScript, our main programming languages. I'm not great at compilers, or broad DevOps ecosystem, never worked on developer tooling, or open-source SDKs.

I enjoy my job a lot, it makes a lot of sense, I enjoy learning from great people, I have a lot of freedom.

IV.

There were two group of companies that I interacted with: ones that invited me for an interview, and ones that allowed me to start collaborating without a formal hiring process. I consistenty choose to work at the latter group, and find them a fun place to be. What's the difference?

Every job of that group meant going out of logical bounds, out of comfort zone, an unexpected move. As a 2nd year student, starting working on device calibration software without any experience with devices. Relocating to another country to work at a multi-national company. Becoming one of the two non-US employees at a startup focused on DevOps tooling.

None of these were "the next logical step" in my career. Maybe I could pass interviews at those companies, but it's also likely I wouldn't. But that's mostly irrelevant, because there wouldn't be a sequence of events that would land me at a boring real-life interview at one of those companies.

What was actually important to get there? Networking. People. Being a son of an engineer helped me get started early on. Doing part-time assignments (халтура?) in my spare time introduced me to people that had enough job and money to move we across countries. Blogging, being active on twitter exposed me to a broader audience that find my skills valuable. If I have to guess where my next job comes from, it's likely it will start from my public activity.

V. 

There's a lot of arguments about interview process being broken. A candidate spends several hours solving computer science puzzles on whiteboard while their future job is fixing bugs in a React app. Some studies suggest the performance of employees at work doesn't strongly correlate with candidate's performance during the interview. One can prep for an interview and game it to some extent. Companies may be too strict at not accepting great candidates and hiring too many poor candidates at the same time. Maybe that's all true.

I'm actually making a different point. It looks like a successful search 

And giving a chance to each other without full-blown employment commitment. Asking me code a simple but useful real-life application. Running a three-week free class for software engineering students. Hiring temporary contractors from distant countries. Those companies get me as their employee.

Being curious about things with no immediate value. Taking part-time contracting in addition to main job. Learning to write in a foreign language and still be useful. Connecting to people, learning from them. That's what helps me discover new avenues.
