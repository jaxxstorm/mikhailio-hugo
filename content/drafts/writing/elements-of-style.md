Correct: Charles's friend

Correct: Oxford comma

"etc." always in commas

Do not use "so" to join two sentences into one. Use "As ..., ..." instead.

"Blake and I stayed home." (not and me, and myself)

Start paragraphs with a topic sentence, then clarify, then a strong statement at the end.

"A survey of this region was made in 1900." => "This region was surveyed in 1900."

Do not use "not" for vagueness. Use positive instead:
"She did not think that studying Latin was a sensible way to use one's time." => "She thought the study of Latin a waste of time."

Save the auxiliaries would, should, could, may, might, and can for situations involving real uncertainty. (avoid otherwise)
