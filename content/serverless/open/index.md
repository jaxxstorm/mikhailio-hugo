The code of cloud functions, infrastructure configuration, and data files for all experiments in [Cold Starts](/serverless/coldstarts/) are published on GitHub.

While I'm working on a better way to cross-link the website pages to the corresponding pieces in source control, here is a plain list of what's available:

- [AWS Lambda functions](https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/cloudbench/tree/master/aws/http)
- [Azure Functions](https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/cloudbench/tree/master/azure/http)
- [Google Cloud Functions](https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/cloudbench/tree/master/gcp/http)
- [Data behind charts](https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/mikhailio-hugo/tree/master/data)
- [Raw measurement data](https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/mikhailio-hugo/tree/master/data/raw)

Feel free to open a new issue on the repositories and post your questions or suggestions.
